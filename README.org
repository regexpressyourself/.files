* Sam's Dotfiles

  A winter project to organize my config files.

** Setting Up
   All these files are managed using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU's stow]]. It was originally made to keep different versions of programs organized neatly, but ends up working well as a kind of symlink manager. To link up files just run: 
   (NOTE: Make sure that this repo is directly in your home directory)
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ stow <directory>
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   For example, if you want to link up my vim files, you could run:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ stow vim
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   To link everything up at once, you can just string the arguments together:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    $ stow emacs  git  i3  scripts  tmux  vim  x  zsh
   #+END_EXAMPLE
