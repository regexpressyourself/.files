** Setting Up

   First, stow the directory as usual.

   These are just a few scripts for stuff that I got sick of doing manually.

   Note: Some files in the scripts directory are added from other folders in this repo. Those files serve very specific purposes, and it made sense to place them with the programs they work with, even if they end up in the ~/scripts directory.

** Files
| Script            | De /script/ ion                                                                                |
