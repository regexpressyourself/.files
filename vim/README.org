* Vim and Neovim Configs

** Setting Up

   First, stow the directory as usual.

** Vim

   My vim setup is meant to be relatively minimalist. I use neovim mostly, but if it fails it's nice to have a coherent fallback. 

   See vimrc for specifics.

** Neovim

   Still not really using Neovim to its full potential, but I really like it so far. vim-plug is amazing as well. 

   See init.vim for specifics.

** Colors 

   I've included a few of my favorite color schemes just so I don't have to go find them every time I set this up.
