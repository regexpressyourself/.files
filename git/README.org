* Git Config

  First, stow the directory as usual.

  Just one file here, the .gitconfig. It has some aliases for git that I like. You will have to change the username, email, etc.

  I can also recommend [[https://github.com/jonas/tig][tig]] if you're looking for a good git terminal interface that has more visual elements.
