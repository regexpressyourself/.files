** Setting Up

   First, stow the directory as usual.

   You will need to install zsh and oh my zsh as well. 

*** Installing zsh
    Use you favorite package manager
**** Setting zsh as default shell
     You will likely need to set zsh as the new default if you're coming from bash. First, make sure you have zsh by running:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      zsh --version
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     If it is installed, you can change it to default by running:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      chsh -s $(which zsh)
     #+END_EXAMPLE
*** Installing oh my zsh
    Simple curl command:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    #+END_EXAMPLE

** Config

   I use a modified version of the [[https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure][Pure theme]], that will be placed in the oh-my-zsh themes directory. My aliases are in the oh-my-zsh custom directory. Any basic config stuff in the in .zshrc file.
